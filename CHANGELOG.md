  - Implemented unique button IDs for empty vs populated states (`add-size` vs `add-size-populated`)
  - Added proper event listeners for both empty state and populated state button variants
- **Tooltips Not Displaying**: Fixed tooltip visibility issues caused by `overflow: hidden` on multiple elements (`.fcc-btn`, `.space-clamp-container`, `.tab-button`, `.font-units-buttons`).

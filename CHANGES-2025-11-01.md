# FSF Changes Log - 2025-11-01

## Context
User requested fixes for Fluid Font Forge (fff) but I mistakenly worked on Fluid Space Forge (fsf). This document logs all changes made before switching to the correct project.

## Branch & Commit Information
- **Branch:** master
- **Last Commit:** 685a476 (Merge bugfix/wordpress-org-security-fixes into master)
- **Date:** 2025-11-01

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed About Container Alignment

**File:** `E:/onedrive/projects/plugins/fsf/assets/css/admin-styles.css`
- **Line:** 285
- **Change:** Fixed `.wrap` centering
  - **Before:** `margin: 0 !important;`
  - **After:** `margin: 0 auto !important;`
- **Reason:** About panel and other containers were not centered, misaligned with header

### 2. Fixed Header Section Centering

**File:** `E:/onedrive/projects/plugins/fsf/assets/css/forge-header.css`
- **Line:** 115
- **Change:** Fixed `.fcc-header-section` centering
  - **Before:** `margin: 0 !important;`
  - **After:** `margin: 0 auto !important;`
- **Reason:** Header section needed proper centering to align with body content

### 3. Fixed About Panel Selector

**File:** `E:/onedrive/projects/plugins/fsf/assets/css/forge-header.css`
- **Line:** 200
- **Change:** Corrected About panel positioning selector
  - **Before:** `.wrap > .fcc-info-toggle-section:first-of-type`
  - **After:** `.all-container > .fcc-info-toggle-section:first-of-type`
- **Reason:** About panel is inside `.all-container`, not directly under `.wrap`

### 4. Fixed JimRWeb Brand References

**Files Changed:**
1. `E:/onedrive/projects/plugins/fsf/templates/admin/new-header.txt` (Line 10)
2. `E:/onedrive/projects/plugins/fsf/templates/admin/header-replacement.txt` (Line 3)
3. `E:/onedrive/projects/plugins/fsf/docs/project-plans/maintainability-roadmap.md` (Line 351)

**Change:** Updated namespace and branding
- **Before:** `\JimRWeb\FluidSpaceForge\FluidSpaceForge` and "JimRWeb"
- **After:** `\JimRForge\FluidSpaceForge\FluidSpaceForge` and "JimRForge"
- **Reason:** Brand standardization - JimRForge is the current brand, not JimRWeb

### 5. Created CODE-REVIEW.md (Partial)

**File:** `E:/onedrive/projects/plugins/fsf/CODE-REVIEW.md`
- **Status:** Started but incomplete
- **Content:** Header and basic structure only
- **Note:** Task was interrupted when error was identified

## Impact Assessment

### Alignment Fixes (Items 1-3)
- **Risk:** Very Low
- **Testing Required:** Visual verification that containers are centered
- **Rollback:** Simple - revert margin changes if issues arise

### Branding Fixes (Item 4)
- **Risk:** Very Low
- **Impact:** Only affects template files not currently in use (backup/reference files)
- **Note:** Main active file (about-section.php) already had correct JimRForge namespace

### CODE-REVIEW.md
- **Status:** Incomplete/In Progress
- **Action:** Can be completed or removed as needed

## Recommendations

1. **Test visual alignment** - Verify About panel and main containers are properly centered
2. **Review branding** - Check if any other JimRWeb references remain
3. **Consider completing CODE-REVIEW.md** - The started review could be valuable for FSF maintenance

## Next Steps

Switching focus to Fluid Font Forge (fff) as originally intended:
- Fix How to Use panel margins
- Fix Sample Text and following panels alignment
- Generate CODE-REVIEW.md for FFF

### Export/Import Settings

- JSON export of complete configuration (settings + all size arrays)
- Import from file to share across projects or restore backup
- Useful when setting up multiple sites with same typography system

### Preset Typography Systems

- Save/load custom presets within the plugin
- Include a few professional presets (e.g., "Editorial", "Tech Blog", "Marketing")
  ...
{
  name: "Editorial",
  description: "Traditional publishing hierarchy for long-form content",
  settings: {
    minRootSize: 16,
    maxRootSize: 18,
    minViewport: 375,
    maxViewport: 1440,
    minScale: 1.200,  // Minor Third - readable on mobile
    maxScale: 1.250,  // Major Third - clear hierarchy on desktop
    unitType: "rem"
  },
  classSizes: [
    { id: 1, className: "headline", lineHeight: 1.1 },
    { id: 2, className: "title", lineHeight: 1.2 },
    { id: 3, className: "subtitle", lineHeight: 1.3 },
    { id: 4, className: "lead", lineHeight: 1.4 },
    { id: 5, className: "body", lineHeight: 1.6 },
    { id: 6, className: "caption", lineHeight: 1.5 }
  ]
}

 Lets developers quickly test different scales without manual setup

### Line Height Calculator

- Currently line-height is manual input per size
- Could calculate optimal line-height based on font size (larger = tighter)
- Formula like: 1.5 - (fontSize - baseSize) * 0.015

### CSS Output Enhancements

- Add media query fallbacks for older browsers
- Generate SCSS/LESS variables alongside CSS
- Option to include container query syntax

### Documentation Generator

- Export a simple HTML style guide showing all sizes with live examples See typography-guide.html
- Helps communicate typography system to team/clients

### Practical concerns:

- Don't add features just to have them
- Each feature adds maintenance burden
- Your plugin already does its core job well
- Consider: Would you actually use these features in your WordPress projects?
